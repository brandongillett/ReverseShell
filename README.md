## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
The purpose of this project is to help junior developers understand sockets in a fun way that they could have possibly learned in cyber security classes(such as i did). The use of threading and subprocesses is something that is demonstrated here as well which makes this a great introduction to cyber security/operating systems for many developers looking to get educated in these fields. Also with many features for the host such as informations on existing clients also demonstrates the use of databases in SQLite.
## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
